- **100% sampled data** vs X-Ray's 5% sampling for more accurate results
- Query "aws/spans" log group with CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Generate business performance insights and summaries
- **IMPORTANT**: Always include a limit in queries to prevent overwhelming context

**Example Query:**
```
FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "payment-service" and attributes.aws.local.environment = "eks:production"
| STATS avg(duration) as avg_latency by attributes.aws.local.operation
| LIMIT 50
```

#### 11. **`query_sampled_traces`** - X-Ray Trace Analysis (Secondary Tool)
**Query AWS X-Ray traces (5% sampled data) for trace investigation**

- **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Consider using `audit_slos()` with `auditors="all"` instead for comprehensive root cause analysis
- Uses X-Ray's 5% sampled trace data - may miss critical errors
- Limited context compared to comprehensive audit tools
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Use `get_service_detail()` for operation discovery and `audit_slos()` for root cause analysis

**Common Filter Expressions:**
- `service("service-name"){fault = true}` - Find traces with faults (5xx errors)
- `duration > 5` - Find slow requests (over 5 seconds)
- `annotation[aws.local.operation]="GET /api/orders"` - Filter by specific operation

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Comprehensive Service Health Audit (Recommended Workflow)
```
User: "Audit the health of all my payment services"
Assistant: I'll perform a comprehensive health audit of all your payment services using the primary audit tool.

[Uses audit_services with wildcard pattern]

audit_services(
  service_targets='[{"Type":"service","Data":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"}}}]',
  auditors="slo,operation_metric"
)

Results: Found 3 payment services with the following findings:

🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS:
• payment-api-service: SLO breach detected - Latency SLO violated (p99: 2.1s > 1.5s threshold)
• payment-processor: High error rate detected (8.2% > 5% threshold)

⚠️ WARNING FINDINGS:
• payment-gateway: Dependency timeout issues with external payment provider

✅ HEALTHY:
• payment-validator: All metrics within normal ranges

Recommendations:
1. Investigate payment-api-service latency issues - check database connection pool
2. Review payment-processor error logs for root cause analysis
3. Consider circuit breaker pattern for payment-gateway external dependencies
```

### Example 2: SLO Breach Root Cause Analysis
```
User: "I have an SLO breach for my checkout service. Can you help me investigate?"
Assistant: I'll help you investigate the SLO breach. Let me first get the SLO configuration and then perform a comprehensive root cause analysis.

[Uses get_slo to understand configuration]
[Then uses audit_slos with auditors="all" for comprehensive analysis]

audit_slos(
  slo_targets='[{"Type":"slo","Data":{"Slo":{"SloName":"checkout-service-latency-slo"}}}]',
  auditors="all"
)

Root Cause Analysis Results:

🔴 SLO BREACH CONFIRMED:
• checkout-service-latency-slo: 87.3% attainment (< 95% goal)
• Breach duration: 2.5 hours
• Impact: 1,247 requests affected

🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
• Database connection pool exhaustion detected
• Trace analysis shows 95% of slow requests waiting for DB connections
• Dependency on payment-service also showing elevated latency

📊 SUPPORTING EVIDENCE:
• P99 latency: 3.2s (threshold: 2.0s)
• Error rate spike: 12% during breach period
• 15 error traces with "connection timeout" messages

🛠️ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Increase database connection pool size from 10 to 25
2. Implement connection pool monitoring alerts
3. Review payment-service dependency performance
4. Consider implementing request queuing for high load periods
```

### Example 3: Operation-Level Performance Investigation
```
User: "The GET operations in my payment services are slow. Can you investigate?"
Assistant: I'll investigate the performance of GET operations specifically in your payment services using operation-level analysis.

[Uses audit_service_operations for precise operation targeting]

audit_service_operations(
  operation_targets='[{"Type":"service_operation","Data":{"ServiceOperation":{"Service":{"Type":"Service","Name":"*payment*"},"Operation":"*GET*","MetricType":"Latency"}}}]',
  auditors="operation_metric,trace"
)

Operation Performance Analysis Results:

🎯 GET OPERATIONS ANALYZED:
• payment-api: GET /api/payments/{id} - P99: 1.8s
• payment-api: GET /api/payments/history - P99: 3.2s ⚠️
• payment-processor: GET /api/process/status - P99: 0.8s ✅

🔴 PERFORMANCE ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
• GET /api/payments/history: Consistently slow (3.2s avg)
  - Root cause: Full table scan on payments table
  - 89% of requests show database query time > 2.5s
  - Missing index on user_id + created_date columns

📈 PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add composite index: CREATE INDEX idx_payments_user_date ON payments(user_id, created_date)
2. Implement pagination for history endpoint (limit 50 records)
3. Consider caching for frequently accessed payment histories
4. Add query timeout protection (max 5s)

🚀 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:
• Estimated latency reduction: 3.2s → 0.4s (87% improvement)
• Database load reduction: ~75%
```

### Example 4: Transaction Search for 100% Trace Visibility
```
User: "I want to analyze all the errors in my checkout service from the last hour"
Assistant: I'll use Transaction Search to analyze all errors with 100% trace visibility (no sampling).

[Uses search_transaction_spans for complete trace data]

search_transaction_spans(
  log_group_name="aws/spans",
  query_string='FILTER attributes.aws.local.service = "checkout-service" and attributes.http.status_code >= 400 | STATS count() as error_count by attributes.http.status_code, attributes.aws.local.operation | SORT error_count DESC | LIMIT 20',
  start_time="2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  end_time="2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
)

✅ Transaction Search Results (100% sampled data):

ERROR BREAKDOWN (Last Hour):
• HTTP 500 errors: 47 occurrences
  - POST /api/checkout/complete: 31 errors
  - POST /api/checkout/validate: 16 errors

• HTTP 404 errors: 23 occurrences  
  - GET /api/checkout/{id}: 23 errors

• HTTP 503 errors: 12 occurrences
  - POST /api/checkout/payment: 12 errors

🔍 KEY INSIGHTS:
• 82 total errors out of 1,247 requests (6.6% error rate)
• Most errors (66%) in checkout completion flow
• Service unavailable errors correlate with payment service dependency

🛠️ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Investigate checkout completion logic for 500 errors
2. Add validation for checkout ID existence (404s)
3. Implement circuit breaker for payment service calls (503s)
```

### Example 5: Service Discovery and Overview
```
User: "What services are being monitored and what's their current health status?"
Assistant: I'll get an overview of all monitored services and their health status.

[Uses list_monitored_services for discovery, then audit_services for health analysis]

Found 8 services being monitored:

📊 SERVICE INVENTORY:
• api-gateway-service (AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi) - Production
• checkout-service (AWS::ECS::Service) - Production  
• payment-api-service (AWS::ECS::Service) - Production
• payment-processor (AWS::Lambda::Function) - Production
• user-service (AWS::EKS::Service) - Production
• inventory-service (AWS::EKS::Service) - Production
• notification-lambda (AWS::Lambda::Function) - Production
• analytics-service (AWS::ECS::Service) - Production

[Then performs health audit]

🏥 HEALTH STATUS SUMMARY:
✅ HEALTHY (5 services):
• api-gateway-service: All SLOs met, low latency
• user-service: Excellent performance metrics
• inventory-service: All operations within thresholds
• notification-lambda: Fast execution, no errors
• analytics-service: Stable performance

⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION (2 services):
• checkout-service: Elevated latency on completion operations
• payment-api-service: Intermittent timeout issues

🔴 CRITICAL (1 service):
• payment-processor: SLO breach - error rate 8.2% (threshold: 5%)

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Focus immediate attention on payment-processor error investigation
2. Monitor checkout-service latency trends
3. Review payment-api-service timeout configurations
```

## Configuration

### Required AWS Permissions

The server requires the following AWS IAM permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "application-signals:ListServices",
        "application-signals:GetService",
        "application-signals:ListServiceOperations",
        "application-signals:ListServiceLevelObjectives",
        "application-signals:GetServiceLevelObjective",
        "application-signals:BatchGetServiceLevelObjectiveBudgetReport",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
        "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
        "logs:GetQueryResults",
        "logs:StartQuery",
        "logs:StopQuery",
        "xray:GetTraceSummaries",
        "xray:BatchGetTraces",
        "xray:GetTraceSegmentDestination"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `AWS_PROFILE` - AWS profile name to use for authentication (defaults to `default` profile)
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (defaults to us-east-1)
- `MCP_CLOUDWATCH_APPSIGNALS_LOG_LEVEL` - Logging level (defaults to INFO)
- `AUDITOR_LOG_PATH` - Path for audit log files (defaults to /tmp)

### AWS Credentials

This server uses AWS profiles for authentication. Set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to use a specific profile from your `~/.aws/credentials` file.

The server will use the standard AWS credential chain via boto3, which includes:
- AWS Profile specified by `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable
- Default profile from AWS credentials file
- IAM roles when running on EC2, ECS, Lambda, etc.

### Transaction Search Configuration

For 100% trace visibility, enable AWS X-Ray Transaction Search:
1. Configure X-Ray to send traces to CloudWatch Logs
2. Set destination to 'CloudWatchLogs' with status 'ACTIVE'
3. This enables the `search_transaction_spans()` tool for complete observability

Without Transaction Search, you'll only have access to 5% sampled trace data through X-Ray.

## Development

This server is part of the AWS Labs MCP collection. For development and contribution guidelines, please see the main repository documentation.

### Running Tests

To run the comprehensive test suite that validates all use case examples and tool functionality:

```bash
cd src/cloudwatch-appsignals-mcp-server
python -m pytest tests/test_use_case_examples.py -v
```

This test file verifies that all use case examples in the tool documentation call the correct tools with the right parameters and target formats. It includes tests for:

- All documented use cases for `audit_services()`, `audit_slos()`, and `audit_service_operations()`
- Target format validation (service, SLO, and operation targets)
- Wildcard pattern expansion functionality
- Auditor selection for different scenarios
- JSON format validation for all documentation examples

The tests use mocked AWS clients to prevent real API calls while validating the tool logic and parameter handling.
